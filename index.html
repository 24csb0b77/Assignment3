        <p>Humayun's tomb (Persian: Maqbara-i Humayun) is the tomb of Emperor Mirza Nasir al-Din Muhammad commonly known
            as Humayun situated in Delhi, India.[1] The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort,
            Empress Bega Begum under her patronage[2][3][4][5][6] in 1558, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his
            son, Sayyid Muhammad,[7] Persian architects chosen by her.[8][9] It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian
            subcontinent,[10] and is located in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as
            Purana Qila (Old Fort), that Humayun found in 1538. It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at
            such a scale.[11][12] The tomb was declared a UNESCO Heritage Site in 1993.

            and since then has undergone extensive restoration work, which is complete.[13]
            Besides the main tomb enclosure of Humayun,several smaller monuments dot the pathway leading up to it, from the main entrance in the West, including
            one that even pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty years; it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niazi, an
            Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals, constructed in
            1547 CE.</p>
